 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Mr. Turtle Coding Journey</h3></summary>
           My journey? Hah! It's quite simple. Somewhere in the middle of nowhere at Anno Domini 2013 I got that crazy idea that I'm going to make a game, but not just any game, it was going to be a game that I'm gonna enjoy playing! So I started with Unity but after few hours of moving cube around and deleted Unity. Next I moved to RPG Maker and as fast as I started, even faster I dropped that idea. What even is ruby and who uses it right?! Right so piss off I'm here to make some cool games not to code some ruby phew. So I moved to the great FPS maker! Which at that time was quite good idea, to the point where I discovered that I can't export my game... Then I moved to Cry engine then crisis which is the same as cry engine, but I didn't know that at that time, and then I used even more others engines that were supposed to make games for me and none of them were so I dropped that idea for a while. But I'm not a p00ssy and I ain't quitting until I make my game, so I back to Unity and tried that thing what it was ah yes PROGRAMMING terrible and awful but hey! Asset store sounds like a good place to start, I downloaded some models drag them to scene hit play aaaaand that shit ain't working. It took me around 2 years to become a programmer right? Not this time, after 2 years of just trying to make a game without coding, I realized that it might be a good idea to try again with that awful programming. I quite don't know why I don't wanted to do that back in the days. It might be of that ugly blue and white monoDevelop or that Unity was supporting 3 languages at that time JavaScripts, some booll bull boll or something like that and of course C#. So As a smart 15y boy I'm choosing C# right? Of course not and we're starting with that BOO language and I'm assuming is called BOO because its scary. Actually I don't even remember a single line from boo because I moved to the C# right? Nope, time for JavaScript as I thought it gonna be easier that C#. I don't know why I just went into js and I even did my first small game using someone else scripts from tutorials but most of them wasn't even working properly and there were a lot of that errors saying Object Reference not set to an instance of an object good lord help me HELP! That guy from tutorial don't had that errors. After around a year maybe 2 I decided that I'm gonna try that gamedev again but this time! This time I'm gonna start from C# course. It was actually called C# for lazy people, and it was enough to understand basic of programming. For a long time I had that mindset where I was using IF for 50 times instead of loops because I was so sure that I don't need them and I know everything I need to make games... And I was so sure about that I even started project called Game With Panda somewhere at the middle of 2018. I wasn't learning much but I was doing a lot or that's what I though I'm doing because a lot of code = a lot of done right?! Nope buuuuttt guess what! At the start of 2019 some guy messaged me that he enjoy my project (I was posting the journey on fb, and it was doing quite well as it got over 1000likes in that period of time, so I was quite proud of that) and that guy told me that he want to invest in my project. I though to my self are you retarded or something the game is barely started but we sing up contract I got some hardware and some money and without almost any knowledge of what Im doing I was coding my game but they wanted to change a lot and it's not like they had bad ideas, they had great ideas but I had no idea how to implement them! And after a few months we lost contact, the game was never finished (BUT HEY! I still have that project, I will finish it one day!) And that game actually must have something in because some time later some other guy told me hey that's quite nice game what about if I pay you for finishing it and for graphic then we publish it and split profits? Oh hell yea we doing it AGAIN! It was early 2020 and with some more experience and some more unfinished project and barely started tutorials here we go again. Game with Panda coming back to live. I changed quite a lot, almost all the only thing that left was PANDA! It even has random world generator and you are able to create your own flying machines! (I thought it was cool but when I think about those tons of ifs instead of loops and all of that code that is written like I would have -10 iq ah lord...) so this time I finished the game and shipped it and make tons of money right? Of course not. My real programming journey starts somewhere at the end of 2021 as I got a job in some crypto play2earn game project that I don't want to mention case they fired me after almost a year not because I was not coding or that my code was low quality (Im not saying it wasn't) but the crypto crashed and they told me hey we can offer you 50% of your current payout or you can fk off. So I took 50% to have money to survive right? Phew Im not a p00sy I ain't working for 50% unless I want to, quite simple you need me more than I need you...  But after that I fell like that's where I truly started to growing. I don't know why but after some time after that my mind just went into grinding mode and In just 2months I fell like I learned more that for past 5 years but guess what, Im just getting started and those 10x developers gonna look like noobs around me so be prepared because Im coming...
